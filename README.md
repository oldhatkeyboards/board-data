CSV files for the Old-hat Keyboards project

## Data Files

There are two CSV files. `keyboards.csv` and `switches.csv`. At least, that's the plan. We're in the extreme alpha phase at the moment. Please send your additions as pull requests. These CSV files can be imported into *any* spreadsheet program.

## Defining Headers In Excel For Use with Screen Readers

To improve the navigation experience with a screen reader, do the following after importing the spreadsheet:

1. Press CTRL+F3. The Name Manager dialog box opens.
2. Use TAB to navigate to the *New*... button and press `ENTER`.
3. Type "Title" without the quotes into the Name edit box. Note the uppercase T.
4. Press `ENTER`.
5. Use `SHIFT+TAB` to navigate to the close button, then press `ENTER`. Yes, you can only get to it using `SHIFT+TAB.

### NOTE

Please note that these steps will need to be repeated _every_ time you open the file in Excel, as plain CSV can't store this information.
